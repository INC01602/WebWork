## jQuery-Ui Plugin explored

It is a set of predefined set of interactions, effects and widgets/themes readily available for use. Visit Plugin website for more info.

### New things here:

1. paragraph `p` tag is inline tag. for block type elements, use `span` tag
2. `$(function() { ... });` is just jQuery short-hand for `$(document).ready(function() { ... });`
What it's designed to do (amongst other things) is ensure that your function is called once all the DOM elements of the page are ready to be used.
